The "Nitter Redirect" Chrome extension is designed to enhance user privacy and control when interacting with Twitter. By default, when a user clicks the "Copy link to Tweet" option on Twitter, it copies a URL that points to Twitter's own website. This extension changes that behavior by replacing the copied Twitter URL with a corresponding URL that points to Nitter, a privacy-focused alternative Twitter front-end.

When a user activates the "Nitter Redirect" extension and copies a tweet link, the extension automatically modifies the URL to direct to Nitter instead of Twitter. This allows users to share tweet links without directing others to Twitter's website, which may be preferred for privacy reasons or to provide a different viewing experience. Additionally, the extension provides a popup dialog that explains its functionality, links to the project's GitHub page, and includes a toggle to enable or disable the feature, giving users full control over the extension's behavior.
